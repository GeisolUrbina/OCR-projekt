            "Historien om FlexQube startade för 30 år sedan i de centrala delarna av Sverige, med tre killar som utvecklade en kärlek för att leka med Lego®. De växte upp och började sina professionella karriärer, men kärleken till att kunna bygga ihop konstruktioner i ett till synes oändligt antal kombinationer försvann inte.\n",
            "\n",
            "Samtidigt som han arbetade för en global tillverkare av anläggningsmaskiner märkte Per Augustsson (CTO, FlexQube) att materialhanteringen inte uppfyllde moderna krav. Industrins normer för svetsade lösningar var inte anpassningsbara nog för att hantera den ständiga förändringen som industrin genomgår. Materialvagnar som användes för transport av artiklar från lagret till monteringsområdet svetsades ihop med en design anpassad för artiklarnas dimensioner och vikt. När en produktlivscykel förändrades, eller en kontinuerlig förbättring skulle genomföras, var en svetsad vagn inte tillräckligt flexibel att förändra. Per Augustsson insåg omedelbart att eftersom produktionslinjerna förändrades allt oftare så ökade behovet av anpassningsbara materialhanteringsvagnar.\n",
            "\n",
            "'Jag insåg att behovet av ett robust och flexibelt koncept för att skapa materialhanteringsvagnar var stort. Ju mer jag undersökte det, desto mer insåg jag att ett koncept med några få standardiserade byggblock var det som behövdes', säger Per.\n",
            "\n",
            "Härifrån föddes begreppet FlexQube av de tre vännerna, som skapade ett professionellt, robust och flexibelt materialhanteringskoncept baserat på standardiserade byggblock.\n",
            "\n",
            "'Konceptet är inspirerat av Lego®, vi använder ett intervall på 7 cm i alla komponenter, så att du enkelt kan utforma och montera dem i olika lösningar och oavsett hur du kopplar samman våra produkter får du samma gränsnitt - precis som med Lego® ' - Anders Fogelberg\n",
            "\n",
            "T ack vare de modulära byggblocken går det snabbt och effektivt att skapa lösningar åt FlexQubes kunder. Sedan starten har FlexQube vuxit och hjälper idag mer än 1000 kunder i 37 länder och kundbasen ökar kontinuerligt. Det rör sig om bland annat kunder inom bilindustrin, industrin för konstruktions- och jordbruksmaskiner, tung fordonsindustri (bussar, lastbilar, tåg), distributions- och lagerindustrier, flygindustrin, vitvaruindustrin, konsumtionsvaror, energi-industrin, tillverkare av medicinsk utrustning och försvarsindustrin.\n",

För det andra skapar vi en stark pool av referensprojekt som kommer att öka vår trovärdighet hos andra potentiella kunder. För det tredje anställer dessa företag duktiga medarbetare som utvecklar sina karriärer snabbt, och inte sällan går vidare till nya verksamheter inom relativt kort tid, där de sedan tar in oss för andra eller tredje gången.

Orderingången fortsatte att öka under hela året med en rekordnivå för orderingången under fjärde kvartalet. Detta var vår första automationsprodukt vi utvecklade och började sälja, och vi har lärt oss mycket på vägen. Automationsprodukter och projekt kräver mer tid från start till mål, både internt men likväl som i försäljningsprocessen hos våra kunder. Därför kan jag fortfarande konstatera att vi bara är i början av vår försäljningsresa för vårt AGV-system, samtidigt som vi lanserar en ny robot som heter FlexQube Navigator AMR i vår nya produktlinje AMR-system. Friheten att skapa skräddarsydda AGV:er med vårt modulära och mekaniska vagnkoncept som bas är mycket attraktiv för våra kunder. Det koncentrerar fokus till materialpresentationen istället för materialtransporten som också är vad vi kallar för användarvänlig automation. Enkel att förstå, lätt att installera och snabb leveranstid. Ett unikt värdeerbjudande på en annars icke diversifierad marknad med många företag som erbjuder mer eller mindre samma produkter.\n",

Under de sista månaderna av 2022 kunde en generell fördröjning i försäljningsprocessen från offert till order identifieras, vilket med stor sannolikhet grundar sig i externa osäkerheter. Det är en tid som kräver balans och att vi lyhört har örat mot rälsen för att kunna ta väl avvägda beslut i hur vi gasar och bromsar verksamheten framåt. Det momentum som byggts upp i bolagets robotförsäljning vill vi i allra högsta grad tillvarata, men det kan inte ske på för stor bekostnad av annat som är av prioritet för bolaget som helhet.\n",

Vår riktning dit vi styr bolaget är tydlig, utan att göra avkall på vårt flexibla och anpassningsbara helhetskoncept. Nuvarande och kommande års fokus på FlexQube Navigator AMR är nästa stora steg i vår robotresa, efter eQart® Line. FlexQube Navigator AMR fyller en tydlig lucka ute i marknaden och det är en produkt som tillåter oss att jobba integrerat och oerhört kund- orienterad samtidigt som vi får maximal användning av FlexQube-konceptet. Vi kan differentiera oss på ett sätt som inte är möjligt i samma utsträckning med traditionella produkter och vi är av övertygelsen att vi lyckats skapa en automationsprodukt för internlogistik i tillverkningsindustrin. Något som ingen lyckats med tidigare. I början av 2023 installerar vi våra första FlexQube Navigator AMR i ett pilotprojekt med en av de största biltillverkarna och vi ser med spänning fram emot vad det kommer leda till.

Redan under föregående år var det tydligt att vi hade en ny typ av organisatoriskt arbete framför oss med att rusta FlexQube för att kunna agera som ett större bolag, däribland var kulturbyggande och än mer intrimmade processer några prioriteter. Kulturbyggande är dock ett arbete som inte är klart på ett år utan det är dynamiskt och fortsätter konstant i takt med tillväxten, men en av nyckelaktiviteterna under det gånga året har varit att stärka HR-avdelningen som tillsammans med ledningen ska driva det interna arbetet väl planlagt och resultatriktat framåt. Det är en grupp drivna människor med höga ambitioner som arbetar hos oss och det är glädjande att de vill investera i sin karriär på FlexQube. Allt fler anställda tecknar optioner i bolaget vilket är ett kvitto på att de verkligen tror på det vi gör och på resan vi har framför oss. Det här är oerhört inspirerande för mig och resten av styrelsen. I strategin framåt för verksamheten ingår också att anpassa organisationen för den ökade robotförsäljningen vi uppnår. Idag är vi jämförelsevis tekniktunga, vilket har varit viktigt för att nå dit vi är idag med våra produkter och erbjudanden, och som en effekt av det framgångsrika arbetet kommer behovet av försäljning, produktion och eftermarknad vara ännu större framgent, vilket bör speglas i hur vi växer och formerar oss.\n",

Kommande struktur ger en möjlighet att företa sig FlexQubes utmaningar och möjligheter med nya ögon, ofärgade av bolagets historik och med andra erfarenheter samt kvalifikationer.

Att rekrytera en ny VD är bland det viktigaste man kan göra i sitt arbete som styrelsemedlem och rekryteringsprocessen visade på ett dynamiskt samspel som grupp. Samtliga har bidragit med relevant expertis för att kvalitetssäkra en process som leder till bästa möjliga resultat. Även om vår nya VD ännu inte är på plats, råder det konsensus om att han är rätt person för jobbet.

Med det sagt vill jag å styrelsens vägnar tacka Anders Fogelberg för allt han uträttat i sin roll som VD för FlexQube och för det fina samarbete som bedrivits. Även om det här fortfarande bara är början på vår resa har FlexQube under Anders Fogelberg utvecklas otroligt väl på endast några år, och han har onekligen varit en central del i det. Det finns många fantastiska historier med Anders genom åren som idag är en del av bolagets DNA. En specifik händelse som jag kommer bära med mig är när  Anders med familjen utan någon som helst tvekan flyttade till USA 2014 när vi insåg att Nord-amerika är rätt marknad för oss för snabb avkastning på våra begränsade medel då. Utan någon social plattform flyttade han med sin fru och deras nyfödda son för att börja bygga våra försäljningsvolymer från 0 till att nu representera ca 150 MSEK och där vårt varumärke växt sig väldigt starkt. Lika mycket som jag vill tacka Anders för hans otroliga arbete vill jag också tacka Anders fru Carolina Fogelberg för det fantastiska arbete hon har lagt ner för att få allt att fungera under alla år. Stort tack Anders och Carolina!\n",
            "\n",

Laguppställningen är därmed ännu starkare nu när vi påbörjar nästa fas i bolaget.\n",

Vår verksamhet frodas i en miljö som ställer krav på innovativa och flexibla lösningar, vilket innebär att vi har både förutsättningarna på marknaden samt verktygen internt att skala upp FlexQube till något riktigt stort. Framtidstron är stark och även om ingen väg är utan hinder så är det generella synsättet att de hinder vi stöter på bör betraktas som utvecklande möjligheter. En grundbult i FlexQubes existens är att varje dag arbeta för att som bolag vara lite bättre än vi var igår. Det kräver hårt arbete, vilja och tillförsikt vilket är något jag kan skriva under på att jag ser varje dag i den här verksamheten.
